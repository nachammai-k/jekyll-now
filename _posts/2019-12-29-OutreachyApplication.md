## What is Outreachy 
Outreachy is an amazing programme that provides internships to work in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).  Outreachy interns work remotely, and are paid a stipend of $5,500 USD for the three month internship. Interns have a $500 USD travel stipend to attend conferences or events.

## How did I get there?
I wanted to use my sabbatical to make some Open source contributions and wanted to start with Linux kernel.  I started off with Linux device drivers, 3rd edition as it was suggested as the starting point in many forums. I was scouring the internet for more details and I landed on a Quora page. I chanced upon Vasihali's answer and that led me to her blog. I read the post for kernel newbies on how to submit a first patch. Surprisingly, it wasn't intimidating.

## Application process

As part of the application process, the applicants have to make contributions to the Open Source project. Linux kernel interns are expected to submit clean-up patches to the linux staging tree. This was a great way to ramp up on git which I had never used earlier. This exercise trains you to effectively create patches and send over email while adhering to the patching guidelines. Apart from this, you get to learn more through the project specific assignments. I learned how to write a kernel module, to use Qemu and ftrace.

The Outreachy linux Co-ordinators were very helpful during this contribution period in guiding the interns on sending the right patches, mailing etiquettes, etc. I was guided by Julia Lawall, Vaishali Thakkar, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

## Concluding remarks
Outreachy provides you a chance to contribute to learn and contribute to Open source. Right from the application process, it is a great opportunity to learn. The mentors encourage you to ask questions. I am four weeks into the internship and it has been a great learning experience.
